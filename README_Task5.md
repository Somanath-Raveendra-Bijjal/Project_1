# Task 6: Unit Testing and Test Automation

This repository contains a Python script for backing up and restoring directories, enhanced with logging and error handling. 
This section describes how to test the functionality of the script using the `unittest` framework.

## Testing Framework

For testing the script, we use Python's built-in `unittest` framework. This allows us to write and run test cases to ensure that the script functions as expected.

## How to Run the Tests

1. **Save** the test script as `test_bulk_pst.py`.

2. **Ensure** that you have Python installed on your system.

3. **Prepare the Test Environment:**
   - The test script creates temporary directories and files for testing purposes. Ensure that you have appropriate permissions to create and delete directories in the location where you run the tests.

4. **Open Terminal or Command Prompt:**
   - **Windows:** Search for "Command Prompt" or "PowerShell" and open it.
   - **Mac/Linux:** Open the Terminal application.

5. **Navigate** to the directory where you saved the test script. Use the `cd` command to change to the directory.
