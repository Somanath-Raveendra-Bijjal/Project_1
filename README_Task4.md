# Task 5: Logging and Error Handling

This repository contains a Python script that enhances backup and restore functionality with robust logging and error handling mechanisms.

## Script Overview

The script performs the following tasks:
1. **Creates** backups of specified directories.
2. **Restores** directories from a backup.
3. **Logs** the entire process, including directory creation, backup, restoration, and error handling.

## How to Run the Python Script

1. **Save** the script as `backup_restore_with_logging.py`.

2. **Ensure** that you have Python installed on your system.

3. **Install** the required libraries if you havenâ€™t already. For this script, you only need the standard library, which is included with Python.

4. **Update** the script with appropriate directory paths:
   - **`source_dirs`**: List of directories you want to back up.
   - **`backup_location`**: Directory where backups will be stored.
   - **`restore_dirs`**: List of directories where backups will be restored.

5. **Open Terminal or Command Prompt:**
   - **Windows:** Search for "Command Prompt" or "PowerShell" and open it.
   - **Mac/Linux:** Open the Terminal application.

6. **Navigate** to the directory where you saved the script. Use the `cd` command to change to the directory.
